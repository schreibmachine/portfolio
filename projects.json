        "description":      "AudioGraph is an interactive, late-night listening experience inspired by the strange intimacy of radio after midnight. The project turns a virtual radio receiver into a space for discovering “audio photographs” — fragments of sound that capture fleeting moods, memories, and moments. \n \n  The application can only be accessed between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., encouraging users to engage with it in the quiet hours when radio feels most personal. At night, a glowing globe becomes active: rotating it lets users tune into hidden sound pieces scattered across its surface. Finding them isn’t straightforward - just like with an old radio, signals fade in and out, and only careful adjustment reveals clear audio. \n  \n Visually minimal and intentionally lo-fi, the project focuses on atmosphere rather than spectacle, drawing from memories of unreliable kitchen radios, late-night callers, and the freedom of off-hour programming. One of the discoverable stations includes an hour-long custom late-night show, blending interviews, music, and storytelling. \n  \n AudioGraph explores radio not just as technology, but as a medium of intimacy, nostalgia, and nighttime wandering - a small world of sounds waiting to be tuned in.",

The closer the alignment, the more intricate and visually pleasing the resulting ink pattern becomes, directly linking gameplay accuracy to visual reward. \n \n The project's visual identity is inspired by the pottery technique mocha diffusion, where acidic pigment reacts with alkaline clay to produce organic branching patterns. To capture this effect authentically, over one hundred real ink reactions were created, filmed, and integrated into the game as animated assets. Even the menu typography was produced using the same process, giving the project a cohesive handcrafted aesthetic. \n \n The result is a minimalist puzzle experience that blends tactile, analogue textures with digital interaction, creating a system that can easily be expanded with additional mechanics and levels. \n \n The project MIRROR.INK was awarded 2nd place at the Deutsche Multimediapreis in 2017 in the 21 - 25 age category in Dresden.",

RABBITHOLE is a fast-paced racing experience testing balance and reflexes, ORIENTATION presents a maze of tunnels that challenges navigation skills, STUCK sends players flying through abstract obstacle fields requiring precision, and MANDALA guides players through shifting viewpoints focused on pattern recognition. Across all levels, players follow or chase geometric shapes that lead them through each environment. \n \n Inspired by artists like James Turrell, the project uses neon color palettes and wireframe visuals to maximize depth and contrast in projected space, creating an immersive experience designed to make players forget the world outside the cube.",

I chose the station U Warschauer Straße, because of it's charming wear and tear which also presented me with a challenge to recreate this. The 3D model of the trainstation consists of the entrance hall, where the transition to track 3 is blocked off, the covered tracks and their open continuation which amounted to approx. 85m. \n \n The topic of '3D Content Tools' was the creation of simple plugins or scripts in AutoDesk Maya. In this course we learned the basics of Maya's Embedded Programming Language, MEL, and were to come up with a useful script to implement. \n Since I simultaneously had the task of recreating a train station with lots of possibly generatable features, it made sense to combine both projects. This was my first venture into the (sometimes fiddly) world of programming for Maya, so I tried to stick to a simple concept: a fence generator.",

        "description":      "VR COOP is a cooperative VR experience built around communication, scale, and shared problem-solving between two players. Each player inhabits a different role: one is a giant who constructs climbable structures, while the other plays a tiny character who climbs them. Progress depends entirely on cooperation - new building platforms only become available once the smaller player unlocks them by being there. \n Because verbal communication is intentionally limited within the experience, players rely heavily on body language and gestures to guide each other. As they build, climb, and negotiate their next steps, each session naturally creates its own small narrative shaped by collaboration and improvisation. \n \n Designed as a focused gameplay slice, VR COOP explores how physical presence, scale differences, and cooperative mechanics can create meaningful interaction in virtual reality, turning simple movement and construction into a shared social experience centered on teamwork and communication. \n \n We developed VR COOP in the summer semester 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and hence created the game excerpt working completely remote.",
