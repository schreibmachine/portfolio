        "description":      "AudioGraph is an interactive, late-night listening experience inspired by the strange intimacy of radio after midnight. The project turns a virtual radio receiver into a space for discovering “audio photographs” — fragments of sound that capture fleeting moods, memories, and moments. \n \n  The application can only be accessed between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., encouraging users to engage with it in the quiet hours when radio feels most personal. At night, a glowing globe becomes active: rotating it lets users tune into hidden sound pieces scattered across its surface. Finding them isn’t straightforward - just like with an old radio, signals fade in and out, and only careful adjustment reveals clear audio. \n  \n Visually minimal and intentionally lo-fi, the project focuses on atmosphere rather than spectacle, drawing from memories of unreliable kitchen radios, late-night callers, and the freedom of off-hour programming. One of the discoverable stations includes an hour-long custom late-night show, blending interviews, music, and storytelling. \n  \n AudioGraph explores radio not just as technology, but as a medium of intimacy, nostalgia, and nighttime wandering - a small world of sounds waiting to be tuned in.",

                            A core memory that drove me to this topic was when I was biking through Treptower Park and heard the ungodly noises that were made by the Heizkraftwerk Klingenberg on the other side of the Spree. \n
                            I originally wanted to tape its sounds, but it has since been upgraded to using gas instead of coal, so the sounds are gone... \n 
                            Luckily (not for our climate of course, but for this project), the Heizkraftwerk Moabit still uses coal, so it still sounds just like HKW Klingenberg used to sound! So I made a little field trip & recorded various sounds from there with my smartphone.",
