        "description":      "AudioGraph is an interactive, late-night listening experience inspired by the strange intimacy of radio after midnight. The project turns a virtual radio receiver into a space for discovering “audio photographs” — fragments of sound that capture fleeting moods, memories, and moments. \n \n  The application can only be accessed between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., encouraging users to engage with it in the quiet hours when radio feels most personal. At night, a glowing globe becomes active: rotating it lets users tune into hidden sound pieces scattered across its surface. Finding them isn’t straightforward - just like with an old radio, signals fade in and out, and only careful adjustment reveals clear audio. \n  \n Visually minimal and intentionally lo-fi, the project focuses on atmosphere rather than spectacle, drawing from memories of unreliable kitchen radios, late-night callers, and the freedom of off-hour programming. One of the discoverable stations includes an hour-long custom late-night show, blending interviews, music, and storytelling. \n  \n AudioGraph explores radio not just as technology, but as a medium of intimacy, nostalgia, and nighttime wandering - a small world of sounds waiting to be tuned in.",

        "description":      "This game prototype presents the first three levels of a scalable puzzle system built around a simple but distinctive mechanic: players control a mirrored axis to guide falling drops into target areas with precision. The closer the alignment, the more intricate and visually pleasing the resulting ink pattern becomes, directly linking gameplay accuracy to visual reward. \n \n The project's visual identity is inspired by the pottery technique mocha diffusion, where acidic pigment reacts with alkaline clay to produce organic branching patterns. To capture this effect authentically, over one hundred real ink reactions were created, filmed, and integrated into the game as animated assets. Even the menu typography was produced using the same process, giving the project a cohesive handcrafted aesthetic. \n \n The result is a minimalist puzzle experience that blends tactile, analogue textures with digital interaction, creating a system that can easily be expanded with additional mechanics and levels. \n \n The project MIRROR.INK was awarded 2nd place at the Deutsche Multimediapreis in 2017 in the 21 - 25 age category in Dresden.",

Success depends on mastering momentum, timing, and spatial reasoning, making each level a small but satisfying challenge. \n \n For this project we emphasized clean, polished design: the game system was intentionally kept simple to allow focus on level design, visual quality, and smooth interaction. Each level combines engaging puzzles with careful attention to physics-based mechanics, creating an intuitive yet rewarding player experience while the development was a great learning opportunity for us. \n \n The game prototype was showcased at HIVE FIVE at HTW, a public exhibition for student projects from Game Design.",
